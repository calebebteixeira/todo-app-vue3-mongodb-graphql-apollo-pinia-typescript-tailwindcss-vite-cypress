# Todo App (Vue 3, MongoDB, GraphQL)

This useless todo app was developed just to show off my skills while practicing with *Vue.js 3* (with composition API), *MongoDB*, *GraphQL*, *Apollo*, *TypeScript*, *Pinia*, *Tailwind CSS* (with dark mode), *Cypress* (for E2E testing) and many other cool dev technologies.

## Node.js Commands

Start Apollo Server
```bash
npm run serve
```

Start Vite
```bash
npm run dev
```

Run end to end testing with Cypress
```bash
npm run test
```

Format all files with Prettier
```bash
npm run format
```

## Technologies 

- [Vue.js 3 (composition API)](https://vuejs.org/): A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): An open source NoSQL database management program used as an alternative to the traditional relational databases.

- [GraphQl](https://graphql.org/): A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

- [Apollo (Vue Apollo v4)](https://v4.apollo.vuejs.org/): A supergraph platform that unifies GraphQL across apps, unlocking faster software development.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/): An end-to-end testing framework for web test automation that enables front-end developers and test automation engineers to write automated web tests in JavaScript.

- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/): A store library for Vue, it allows you to share a state across components/pages and provides a simpler API than VUEX.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A higly customizable utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/): It offers a way to write styles for websites with more enhanced CSS syntax.

- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/): A module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): An open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript and helps you maintain your code quality with ease.

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account.
